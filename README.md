# BTRealEstate
This is a real estate website designed using django and backend using postgresql. This project deals with listings and realtors and their realtionships.

For cloning this project , you must need to create a virtual environmnet, install django, pgsql, psycopg2, and few other additional extensions.
I have also used jinja templating in this project.
